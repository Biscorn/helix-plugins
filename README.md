## Hey there ! 🙋‍♂️

Public stuff that I've made for [Helix](https://github.com/NebulousCloud/helix) a framework for [Garry's Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/).

Feel free to reach me on Discord **#hern9** for any suggestions or projects.
If you have any bugs related or issues with a plugin, open an [issue](https://github.com/Biscorn/helix-plugins/issues).

Use it at your convenience, I hope it will be useful to your project !
Don't forget to credit my work at least.

## Sprinting Prevention
Description : Self explicit. Will prevent your player to "sprint" (by default the SHIFT key from the client) backward, left and right side.

**Note :** You don't need to specify the pressed client key.

## ShowCID
Description : A command that can be run by a player (which play a character) to display critical informations about its own identity (such as name, and ID).
Check the configuration for extra features and better control.

## Unique CID
Description : Don't you ever dreamt to identify each citizen uniquely ? Well, with this plugin, your dream will become true !

**Note :** Will be uploaded soon.

## Spoiled Items
Description : Use the base_food entity base to make specific entity that can be marked as "spoiled".

**Note :** Does nothing on its own. You need additionnal Lua skills.
For example, if you have an "attribute" plugin the system will be interesting to implement with.

## Plane Drop
Description : An airplane will cross the map and randomly drop cases with loot inside each crate (up to 3), and configurable. Each crate is randomly generated and its content is randomly generated according to a config file.

**Note :** It can clearly be improved and optimized at some point (usage of the think function, item shuffling, configuration for better control...).

## Corpse Search
**Note :** Will be uploaded soon.

## Join/Left Player Base Logger
Description : A connection logger for your administration team. Register your players with its informations and data (such as IP address) etc. It can be really useful as it can give you trends about your player base or might help you identify unexpected connection pattern or malicious activities. I recommend you use it for analytics purposes.

**Note :** Will be uploaded soon.
> **Note :** If you can't manage to run or execute SQL commands (queries), it won't be useful neither give you any insightful trends.
