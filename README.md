## Hey there ! 🙋‍♂️

Public stuff that I've made for [Helix](https://github.com/NebulousCloud/helix) a framework for [Garry's Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/).

Feel free to reach me on Discord **#hern9** for any suggestions or projects.
If you have any suggestions or bug related to a plugin, open an [issue](https://github.com/Biscorn/helix-plugins/issues).

Use it at your convenience, I hope it will be useful to your project !

## Sprinting Prevention
Self explicit. Will prevent your player to "sprint" (by default SHIFT key) backward, left and right side.
No optimization found.

## ShowCID
A command that can be run by a player (which play a character) to display critical informations about its own identity (such as name, and ID).
If the player doesn't have its own CID - the card itself - in his inventory, he will say something else than its informations.

## Spoiled Items

**Note :** This is unfinished work.

## Plane Drop

> **Note :** It can clearly be improved.

## Corpse Search
Will be uploaded soon.

## Join/Left Player Base Logger

> **Note :** If you can't manage to run or execute SQL commands, it won't be useful neither give you any insightful trends.
