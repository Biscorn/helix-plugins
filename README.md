## Hey there ! 🙋‍♂️

Public stuff that I've made for [Helix](https://github.com/NebulousCloud/helix) a framework for [Garry's Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/).

Feel free to reach me on Discord **#hern9**, but I do not provide __personnal support__ for the plugins.
If you have any suggestions or bug related to a plugin, open an [issue](https://github.com/Biscorn/helix-plugins/issues).

Use it at your convenience, I hope it will be useful to your project !
