## Hey there ! 🙋‍♂️

Public stuff that I've made for [Helix](https://github.com/NebulousCloud/helix) a framework for [Garry's Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/).

Feel free to reach me on Discord **#hern9** for any suggestions or projects.
If you have any bugs related or issues with a plugin, open an [issue](https://github.com/Biscorn/helix-plugins/issues).

Use it at your convenience, I hope it will be useful to your project !
Don't forget to credit my work at least.

## Sprinting Prevention
Self explicit. Will prevent your player to "sprint" (by default the SHIFT key from the client) backward, left and right side.
> **Note :** You don't need to specify the pressed client key.
> No optimization has been found.

## ShowCID
A command that can be run by a player (which play a character) to display critical informations about its own identity (such as name, and ID).
If the player doesn't have its own CID - the card itself - in his inventory, he will say something else than its informations.

## Spoiled Items
Will be uploaded soon.

 **Note :** Does nothing on its own. You need additionnal Lua skills to do something with. For example, imagine you have an attribute plugin... and then you implement it with the spoil system.

> **Note :** This is unfinished work.

## Plane Drop
Will be uploaded soon.
> **Note :** It can clearly be improved.

## Corpse Search
Will be uploaded soon.

## Join/Left Player Base Logger
Will be uploaded soon.
> **Note :** If you can't manage to run or execute SQL commands (queries), it won't be useful neither give you any insightful trends.
