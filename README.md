## Hey there ! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Stuff that I've made for [Helix](https://github.com/NebulousCloud/helix) a framework for [Garry's Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/) usually called ""Gamemode"".

Feel free to contact me, but I do not provide a __personnal support__.
If you have any suggestion or a general bug related to a plugin, open an [issue](https://github.com/Biscorn/helix-plugins/issues).

Use it at your convenience if it is useful for your project ! Hope it will be.
